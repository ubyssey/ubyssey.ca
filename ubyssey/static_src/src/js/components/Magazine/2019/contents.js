  title: "A letter from the editor",
  paragraphs: [`We are a campus of over 60,000 people, all with different stories, backgrounds, trials, and tribulations. 
  How does UBC support or hinder those differences? How do we --- as individuals, departments, and communities at a university --- claim our own space?
  How do we continue to evolve and grow when the campus around us seems not to fit us? How do we stand up for our beliefs?
  How do we continue to be us and celebrate our diversity?
  In this year's Ubyssey magazine, we opened the doors to the various cultures, stories, ways of life and perspectives that make UBC the unique place it is today ---
  and discussed how we make our presence known on campus, be that through reclaiming and fighting for our space, holding our own or beginning to include ourselves in the folds of UBC's tapestry.
  Thank you to all who helped write, illustrate, edit, produce, and imagine the possibilities for this magazine. You've created the beautiful building blocks for a little haven of support and celebration within these pages and I am so proud of the work that you have produced. For those who shared your stories, thank you for your courage, honesty, and openness.
  This magazine is just the beginning of all the incredible stories waiting to be told on our campus about how students, staff, and faculty have shaped and continue to shape our university identity.
  We hope it acts as a stepping stone for you to share yours.
