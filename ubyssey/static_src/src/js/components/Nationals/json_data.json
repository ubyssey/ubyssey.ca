The Thunderbirds posted the best regular season results in Canada West Pacific at 13-1-2. The only loss for the ’Birds came at the hands of the Thompson Rivers Wolfpack in the final game of the season after UBC had secured top spot and rested a few players in the second of a back-to-back road weekend. The rock solid defensive play of the T-Birds this season alongside superb goalkeeping from Jason Roberts has earned them eight clean sheets. Roberts held the collective opposition to just 7 goals in 14 games. Evidently, they are a bit of a powerhouse in the West. It remains to be seen how they will line up against the rest of the country’s best."],

Since then, he has been the poster boy up front for UBC and a centrepiece around the box that opposing teams have struggled to contain. Yli-Hietanen is a physical presence at 6’1” that has a keen eye for holes in an opposing team’s back line."],

If the Spartans want to continue their regular season success in the national tournament, they may need to tighten up on the back end.

They shared the lowest goals-against tally with fellow RSEQ national representatives, the Carabins, at just nine all year. They are lead by a core of senior players in the back, which lends well to their playing style going into nationals this year. If the older guys on the roster can continue to lead by example and maybe even bang a few goals in, which they have been doing this year, the Citadins will be ones to watch this coming weekend as an outside threat for the title."],

They are a highly-organized team who are not only capable of racking up goals in their more dominant games, but can also squeak out a win in their tougher matchups. History is perhaps on their side too, as the Carabins made it all the way to the national final last season. They’ve been in the high-stakes games, they’ve lost on the biggest stage in Canadian university soccer and they are likely out for some redemption.
