  This is boilerplate code, usually generated by Google Ad Manager that uses Google's "Google Publisher Tag" library.
  
  # Where did this code come from?
  
  Log into Google Ad Manager, select Inventory > Ad Units in the left menu, select an ad unit, select the "Tags" tab,
  and follow the instructions. Ad Manager will generate two "tags", i.e. snippets of JavaScript code, to be inserted
  into an HTML document. This corresponds to the "tag" that you will be instructed to insert into the <head> element
  of the web page. Django is used to automate the generation of these "tags" since they all follow a similar pattern. 

  A single line is omitted here:
  
    <script async src="https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/tag/js/gpt.js"></script>

  This line is instead moved to the template ubyssey/base.html, since the gpt library will be used more than once after
  it is loaded.

  If there are errors with the ads, check this code against what Google Ad Manager outputs for the Ad Unit that is
  erroring.
